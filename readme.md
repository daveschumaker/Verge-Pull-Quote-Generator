[*The Verge*](http://theverge.com) is a pretty popular news site that often features all sorts of stories. One feature that they frequently make use of is the "pull quote."

So, what is a pull quote??

> A pull quote (also known as a lift-out pull quote) is a quotation or excerpt from an article that is typically placed in a larger or distinctive typeface on the same page, serving to entice readers into an article or to highlight a key topic.
The term is principally used in journalism and publishing.

(Via [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_quote))

Use of pull quotes by *The Verge* have been noticed by others, including a fun Twitter account that highlights the publication's use of pull quotes called [@vergepullquotes](https://twitter.com/vergepullquotes).

I decided to get some practice working on front end web development types of problems and created this *Verge Pull Quote Generator* script.

Simple type in your witty quote and you can see what it would look like if it were featured prominently within one of their stories. Have some fun with it and go to town!
